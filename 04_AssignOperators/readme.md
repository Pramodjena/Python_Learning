## Assignment Operators 

The assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. The most common assignment operators are:

### Assignment (=)

The basic assignment operator assign the on the right side to the variable on the left side.

```python

x = 10 # Assign 10 to the variable x

```
### Addition Assignment (+=)

Adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.

```python 

x += 5 # x = x + 5, so x = 15

```
### Subtraction Assignment (-=)

Subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result to the variable.


```python 

x -= 5 # x = x - 5, so x = 10

```
### Multiplication Assignment (*=)

Multiplies the current value of the variable on the left by the value by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```python 

x *= 5 # x = x * 5, so x = 50

```

### Division Assignment (/=)

Divides the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result to the variable.

```python

a = 8
a /= 4 # a = a / 4, so a = 2

```

### Floor Division Assignment (//=)

Perform floor division on the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns

```python
b = 17
b //= 4 # b = b // 4, so b = 4

```
### Modulus Assignment (%=)

Computes the modulus of the current value of the variable on the left divided by the value on the right hand and assigns the result to the variable.

```python

x = 10
x %= 3 # x = x % 3, so x = 1

```

### Exponentiation (**=)

Performs floor division on the current value of the variable on the left by the value on right and assigns the result to the variable.

```python

c = 2
c **= 3 # c = c ** 3, so c = 8

```
