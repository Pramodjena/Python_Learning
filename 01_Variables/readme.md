# What is a Programming Language?

Definition:

A programming language is a formal set of instructions and rules that allow humans to write code that computers can understand and execute.

Key Points:

- It acts as a bridge between humans and computers.

- It allows us to give commands to the computer to perform tasks.

- Programming languages have their own syntax (rules on how to write instructions).

- Examples: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, and many more.

Why Programming Languages?

- Computers only understand machine code (binary 0s and 1s).

- Programming languages help write instructions in a human-readable way.

- These instructions are then translated (compiled or interpreted) into machine code the computer can execute.

# Python 

Python is a type-inferred language, so you don't have to explicitly define the variable type.

Type-Inferred : 
- Type inference means that the programming language automatically figures out the data type of a variable based on the value you assign to it.

#### Runtime = `The whole time your program is alive and running.`

#### Execution = `The steps or actions the computer takes while the program is running.`


### What is Compiled?

Definition:

- A compiled language is one where the source code is translated entirely into machine code by a compiler before it is run.

Key Points:

- The compiler reads the whole program at once, translates it into machine code (binary), and creates an executable file.

- That file can be run directly by the computer (without needing the compiler again).

- Errors are usually detected at compile time.

## What is Interpreted?
Definition:

- An interpreted language is one where the source code is read and executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.

Key Points:

- No separate machine code file is created.

- Code is executed immediately after being read.

- Errors are found during runtime.

`Python Example: Compilation + Interpretation`

Python is first compiled into bytecode (intermediate code), and then that bytecode is interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

So, Python uses both compilation (to bytecode) and interpretation (of that bytecode).

What is Bytecode?

- Bytecode is a low-level, intermediate code that is generated by the compiler from your high-level source code (like Python or Java).

- It is not human-readable, but it's not machine code either — it's designed to be executed by a virtual machine.

- Bytecode is like a "universal language" that your program is converted into, so that a virtual machine (like the Python Virtual Machine or Java Virtual Machine) can run it on any computer.

What is a Virtual Machine?

- A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs programs as if it were a real physical computer — but inside another system.

- In programming languages like Python or Java, a virtual machine executes bytecode, not high-level source code directly.


```python

# Simple Working Flow (Python Example):

print("Hello")

# Python source code (.py)
# ⬇️

# Compiled to bytecode (.pyc)
# ⬇️

# Executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)

```


## Variables 

A variable is a symbolic name that is used to store and represent data values. It's essentially a label or identifier for memory location where a value is stored.


```python

# variable assignment
age = 26   # assignment creates and sets the variable

# assigning a new value 
age = 27

# variable reference 
print("my age is", age )

```

## Identifier 

- Identifier is a name given to entities like variables, functions, classes, modules etc. It helps to uniquely identify those entity in the program.

### Rules of Identifier 

1. It must start with a letter (a-z/A-Z) or an underscore (_).

2. The remaining characters can be letter, underscores or digits (0-9).

3. Python is case sensitive so `variable` and `Variable` is different identifiers.

4. Reserved keywords are not allowed.

### Conventions for naming identifiers

1. Use descriptive names to make the code more readable.

2. Avoid using names that are too short or too cryptic.

3. Use underscore to separate words in a multi-word identifier (snake_case). For example my_variable.

4. For constants use all uppercase letters with words separated by underscore (UPPERCASE). For example MAX_VALUE.
