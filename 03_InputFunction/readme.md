## Input Function 

input() function is used to take input from the user during the execution of a program. The input() function reads a line of test from the user as a "string" and returns that "strings". It allows the user to provide input interactively.

```python 

# Getting inputs from user
user_input = input("Enter something: ")
print("You entered: ", user_input)

# Get user input as integer
user_input_int = int(input("How old are you: "))
print("You are", user_input_int, "years old")


# Square of a num 
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Square of the number is: ", num**2)

```
